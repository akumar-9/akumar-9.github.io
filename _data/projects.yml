# Projects



- project: Cancer Diagnosis using Deep Neural Networks
  role: Team Lead
  duration: Apr 2024 &mdash; May 2024
  url: "https://github.com/akumar-9/DANNs-for-Cancer-Diagnosis"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Analyzed a dataset of 698 patient records with nine quantitative health metrics and a binary cancer diagnosis label.</li><li> Designed and implemented a data preprocessing pipeline, including dataset splitting (70/15/15 for training, validation, and testing), normalization, and feature scaling, leading to a 97% model accuracy in cancer classification.</li></ul>
